# Source Map Warning Solution

## Issue
The project was experiencing source map warnings related to the `dagre-compound` package:

```
WARNING in ./node_modules/dagre-compound/dist/dagre-compound.es5.js
Module Warning (from ./node_modules/source-map-loader/dist/cjs.js):
Failed to parse source map from 'D:\work\workflow-front\node_modules\dagre-compound\src\core\config.ts' file: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

These warnings occur because the source-map-loader (included in react-scripts) is trying to load source maps for better debugging, but the TypeScript source files referenced in the source maps don't exist in the expected locations.

## Solution
Created a `.env.development` file with the following content:

```
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

This disables source map generation in development mode, which prevents the source-map-loader from attempting to load the missing source maps.

## Why This Works
- The `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP` environment variable is recognized by Create React App and controls whether source maps are generated during the build process.
- By setting it to `false` in the development environment, we're telling webpack not to generate or load source maps, which eliminates the warnings.
- This only affects the development environment, so production builds will still include source maps if needed.
- This is a minimal solution that doesn't require ejecting from Create React App or creating custom webpack configurations.

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Custom webpack configuration**: We could have created a custom webpack configuration to ignore specific source map warnings, but this would require ejecting from Create React App or using tools like react-app-rewired.
2. **Global .env file**: We could have used a global `.env` file instead of `.env.development`, but this would affect all environments including production.
3. **Update the package**: If a newer version of the dagre-compound package exists with fixed source maps, updating the package would be another solution.

## Impact
This solution:
- Eliminates the source map warnings during development
- Has no impact on the functionality of the application
- Slightly reduces the debugging capabilities for third-party libraries in development mode
- Does not affect production builds
